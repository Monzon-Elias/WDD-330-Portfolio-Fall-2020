                    The Canvas Object is new in HTML5. Canvas is a container for graphics in which, 
                    through script, we can draw graphics. In this instance I've created an animated 
                    frame to frame movie of a galloping horse from an image that is a film with 12 frames, 
                    I create rectangles with <i>new Path2D()</i>, and clipped them
                    inside the <i>canvas</i> element, one by one, using <i>setTimeout()</i>.<br> 
                    The Video element is a new HTML 5 tag. It has many properties accessible by DOM. 
                    Here I have created a video element with basic controls and autoplay = true. <br>
                    The Audio element is a new HTML 5 tag. It shares almost all the video tag properties. 
                    Here I have added an audio tag with basic controls, with no autoplay.
