    <h2>Week 5 activity</h2>
    <p>Here we "traslated" the original hikes web site code into a "classy" approach.
        The methods (actions) are executed when an instance of the class is created
        outside the class. This happens because previously, we set a call to the 
       <i> showHikeList()</i> method inside the constructor of the Hikes class.</p>
    <p>We also used one module to store the hikes array, and export it.
        Then we imported it into our <i>hikes.js</i> file</p>
